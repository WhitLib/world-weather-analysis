Using APIs to Visualize Weather Data

### 1 Overview

The purpose of this project was to elevate the PlanMyTrip App and implement changes to bring the app and the experience for its users to the next level. In this module, we've added each city's weather description to help travelers make a more calculated decision on which cities they'd like to visit. Using the weather data already retrieved in the module, beta testers were able to use input statements to filter the data based on weather preferences that narrow down vacation destinations and nearby hotels. 

Then, from the compiled list of potential travel destinations, beta testers were able to designate numerous cities to travel to and create a vacation itinerary. Lastly, using the Google Maps Directions API, testers could add an additional layer to their itinerary to construct a travel route between cities using their travel mode of choice.
